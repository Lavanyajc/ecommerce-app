#####"We push changes to the main branch, which triggers GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
#In the CI (Continuous Integration) step, the workflow checks out the code and prepares the files by locating the index.html inside the frontend folder.
#Once CI passes, in the CD (Continuous Deployment) step, GitHub Actions takes the index.html file and pushes it to the gh-pages branch.
#Finally, GitHub Pages serves the website from that branch, making the latest version live.
